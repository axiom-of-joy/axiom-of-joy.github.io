# Axiom of Joy

A whimsical math and data science portfolio.

## Welcome!

My name's Alexander, but my friends call me Xander. This website is my platform to explore my passions for mathematics and data science, to showcase projects and papers, and to engage with the wider data science community.

## About This Site

This site was built using the static site generator Jekyll with the Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog theme.
