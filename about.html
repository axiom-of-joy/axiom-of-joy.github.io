<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>My name's Alexander, but my friends call me Xander. This website is my platform to explore my passions for mathematics and data science, to showcase projects and papers, and to engage with the wider data science community.</p>

<h1>About Myself</h1>

<img src="/img/headshot.png" class="avatar1" alt="A scholar and a gentleman.">

<p>I studied philosophy at UC Berkeley and mathematics at the <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu/about">College of Creative Studies</a> at UC Santa Barbara. In between, I taught English at a South Korean elementary school through the Fulbright Program. I have research experience in linear algebra and machine learning and recently co-authored my <a href="https://repository.uwyo.edu/ela/vol34/iss1/36/">first paper<a/>. I love challenging projects that make a positive impact in people's lives. You can view my resume <a href="/downloads/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
